# MORFIT YC APP

### What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do

---

MorFit shows you how to have the perfect body and still eat pizza or drink beer.

The goal of MorFit is to be the simplest, easiest and most enjoyable way to reach fitness and health goals.

We achieve this by providing two components.

1. A nutritional system that focuses on simplicity and sustainability to optimize user experience.
2. The implementation of this system mainly through a client application but also through admin infrastructre to support the client app.

MorFit allows users to enjoy their favorite foods, provides easy to reach nutritional goals and does the heavy lifting in terms of nutritional knowledge.

### Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible

---

Me and Diego Morales developed a training system that relies on Minimum Effective Dose principles to significantly reduce training frequency and duration and still provide optimal results.

<br>

### How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

---

Met at age 3 and have been lifelong friends, going through elementary school, high school and college as a team. I think that this is one of our greatest strengths as a company.

<br>

### How far along are you?

---

Lanched first commercial product in February 2021. Release a major update in September 2021 and plan to release major updates by early next year. Current version of the product has generated over 400 conversions.

<br>

### How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

---

Started in November 2020 and developed an MVP. Started working full time after official launch in February 2021.

<br>

### How many active users or customers do you have? If you have some particularly valuable customers, who are they? If you're building hardware, how many units have you shipped?

---

Over 400 customers with an average LTV of $44. Within our active users we found that people who understand the system and apply it to achieve results are blown away by the fact that they can look and feel better and still enjoy "bad" foods. This makes them act as extreme promoters of the product and to quote them "I can't stop talking about MorFit and I want everyone to use it".

<br>

### Anything else you would like us to know regarding your revenue or growth rate?

---

Paraguay has relatively low adoption rate of technology and also low access to financial and banking institutions. This might have an effect on our current growth rate.

<br>

### If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

---

Participated in a local startup competition with a "pre-accelator" program. They provided some good mentoring as well as insights. After the program we won the competition and received a $10,000 prize.

<br>

### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

---

Most people are actively trying to look better or become healthier yet very few of them can actually achieve lasting results and at the same time enjoy the process. This is simply due to the fact that traditional diets give a horrible experience.

Since 15, I have been keeping up with the latest nutritional research and basically have been a human guinea-pig to test all the different approaches to nutrition.

All this experience in addition to peoples take on diets, have led me to understand that people want to find a way to reach their fitness/health goals but also be able to enjoy food along the way.

<br>

### What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

---

1. We only provide three nutritional targets (Calories, Protein, Fiber). This greatly reduces the load on users as they only have to manage three numbers in order to achieve their goals.
2. Internal Food Database: We manage our own food database to provide a better user experience. Most other trackers make users create their own food items but this requires significant effort and domain knowledge. By having our database we also can provide extra functionality such as index-based queries, localization of food items and verification of nutritional information.
3. We use visual aid to facilitate food tracking. Other trackers have users manually weigh their food to track it, but this is way to tedious and time consuming. We rely on food photo references for all the items to avoid this.
4. Built-in coaching system. We provide a coaching system that performs weekly checkups to adjust a users targets in response to things such as metabolic adaptation, progress and main goals.

Peope rely on food trackers such as MyFitnessPal as substitutes.

<br>

### Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?

---

Carbon Diet Coach is probably the only other product to offer a coaching system to guide users to their goals. Other trackers fall short and provide basic functionality.

<br>

### What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

---

Tracking food can quite tedious and off-putting for new users. This is by far the biggest barrier of entry to adoption a system like MorFit. Other trackers place their focus in either nutritional content or coaching systems.

We try to focus first and foremost on solving this issue by getting user-feedback and continously iterating to provide a better user experience.

The two main ways we are implementing this are

1. Visual aid to replace manual weighing of food (Currently working on deeplearning models to allow users to take a picture of a food item and automatically track it)
2. Internal Food Database so users can simply search for foods and track it, as opposed to having to create their own food items.

<br>

### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

---

Subscription service with monthly, bi-annually and annual plans. We estimate that we could get at least 10 million premium users which would generate 840 million in annual revenue.

<br>

### How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

---

We have four main channels for getting users.
Direct Marketing through targeted ads. This method utilizes channels such as Facebook and Google ads to reach new customers.

Content-Engagement. This channel involves the creation of creative and educational content to engage and grow the MorFit community.

Network Effect. Active users who reach results become promoters of the product to their peers. These people not only help get new users but actively help other users through the process. This creates a strong network effect for MorFit.

Referral System. We utilize a referral system where users can invite others to join MorFit and get special promotional prices.

<br>

### Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

---

Santiago Racca. All the product development was done in-house.

<br>

### Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.

---

In paraguay, it is commonly though that there is a strong culture for drinking beer. We were amused to confirm this upon seeing that beer is the number one tracked item for 35 weeks straight with a total of over 200 thousand beers tracked.

### What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply?

Reality kicked in when we launched the product and there is so much we still need to learn. YC seems like the perfect place to find the answers we are looking for.
