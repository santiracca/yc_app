# MORFIT YC APP

### What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do

---

MorFit shows you how to have the perfect body and still eat pizza and drink beer.

The goal is to be the simplest, easiest, and most enjoyable way to reach fitness and health goals.

We achieve this by providing two components:

1. A nutritional system that focuses on simplicity and sustainability to optimize user experience.
2. The implementation of this system mainly through a client application but also through admin infrastructure to support the client app.

MorFit is essentially an interface for nutrition; an abstraction of optimized human diets that leaves the implementation to the users. It allows users to enjoy their favorite foods, provides easy-to-reach nutritional goals and does the heavy lifting in terms of nutritional knowledge.

### Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible

---

Diego Morales and I developed a training system that relies on Minimum Effective Dose principles to significantly reduce training frequency and duration and still provide optimal results with regards to muscle gain and fat loss.

<br>

### How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

---

We met at age 3 and have been lifelong friends, going through elementary school, high school and college as a team. I think that this is one of our greatest strengths as a company.

<br>

### How far along are you?

---

Launched first commercial product in February 2021. Released a major update in September 2021 to include a nutritional coach that provides users direct feedback and plan to release major updates primarily deep learning models that allow users to snap photos of their food and track it by early next year. The current version of the product has generated over 400 customers.

<br>

### How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

---

We started in November 2020 and developed an MVP and started working full time after our official launch in February 2021.

<br>

### How many active users or customers do you have? If you have some particularly valuable customers, who are they? If you're building hardware, how many units have you shipped?

---

Over 400 customers with an average LTV of $44. Within our active users we found that people who understand the system and apply it to achieve results are blown away by the fact that they can look and feel better and still enjoy "unhealthy" foods. This makes them act as extreme promoters of the product and to quote them "I can't stop talking about MorFit and I want everyone to use it".

<br>

### Anything else you would like us to know regarding your revenue or growth rate?

---

Paraguay has a relatively low adoption rate of technology and low access to financial and banking institutions. This might have negatively influenced our current growth rate.

<br>

### If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

---

We participated in a local startup competition with a "pre-accelator" program. They provided some good mentoring as well as insights regarding improving our UX. We won the competition and received a $10,000 prize with no equity commitments.

<br>

### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

---

Most people are actively trying to look better or become healthier, yet very few of them can actually achieve lasting results and at the same time enjoy the process. This is simply because traditional diets are a restrictive and unpleasant (horrible) experience.

Since age 15, I have been keeping up with the latest nutritional research and basically have been a human guinea pig to test all the different approaches to nutrition.
This experience, in addition to the general public’s take on diets, has led me to understand that people want to find a way to reach their fitness/health goals but also be able to enjoy food along the way.

<br>

### What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

---

1. We provide only three nutritional targets (calories, protein, fiber). This greatly reduces the load on users as they only have to manage three numbers in order to achieve their goals.
2. Internal Food Database: We manage our own food database to provide a better user experience. Most other trackers force users to create their own food items, but this requires significant effort and domain knowledge. By having our database, we also can provide extra functionality such as index-based queries, localization of food items and verification of nutritional information.
3. We use visual aid to facilitate food tracking. Other trackers have users manually weigh their food to track it, but this is way too tedious and time consuming. We rely on food photo references for all the items to facilitate this user experience.
4. Built-in coaching system. We provide a coaching system that performs weekly checkups to adjust a user’s targets in response to things such as metabolic adaptation, progress, and main goals.

People rely on food trackers such as MyFitnessPal as substitutes.

<br>

### Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?

---

Carbon Diet Coach is the only other product we’re familiar with to offer a coaching system that guides users in their goals. Other trackers fall short and provide basic functionality.

<br>

### What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

---

Tracking food can be quite tedious and off-putting for new users. This is by far the biggest barrier of entry to adoption of a system like MorFit. Other trackers place their focus in either nutritional content or coaching systems.

We try to focus first and foremost on solving this issue by getting user-feedback and continuously iterating to provide a better user experience.

The two main ways we are implementing a solution are:

1. Visual aid to replace manual weighing of food (currently working on deep learning models to allow users to take a picture of a food item and automatically track it)
2. Internal Food Database so users can simply search for foods and track it, as opposed to having to create their own food items.

<br>

### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

---

Subscription service with monthly, bi-annual, and annual plans. We estimate that we could get at least 10 million premium users which would generate 840 million in annual revenue.

<br>

### How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

---

We have four main channels for getting users:

1. Direct Marketing through targeted ads. This method uses channels such as Facebook and Google ads to reach new customers.

2. Content-Engagement. This channel involves the creation of creative and educational content to engage and grow the MorFit community.

3. Network Effect. Active users who reach results become promoters of the product to their peers. These people not only help get new users but actively help other users through the process. This creates a strong network effect for MorFit.

4. Referral System. We use a referral system where users can invite others to join MorFit and get special promotional prices.

<br>

### Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

---

Santiago Racca. All the product development was done in-house.

<br>

### Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.

---

In Paraguay, it is commonly thought that there is a strong culture for drinking beer. We were amused to confirm this upon seeing that beer is the number one tracked item for 35 weeks straight with a total of over 200 thousand beers tracked.

### What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply?

Reality kicked in when we launched the product with so much yet to learn about growing our product in the global market. YC seems like the perfect place to find the answers we are looking for.
